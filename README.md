Minos :: Minotaur Kings
=======================

Minos :: Minotaur Kings is a ridiculous game in which minotaurs compete 
in medieval football through mazes to claim the title of king... 
Oh! And you don't see the games being played and you don't know how it 
works so you have to read the code and/or do statistical analysis to 
improve your team. It's going to be terrible. 

Try it. 

Reading The Code :: Where To Start
==================================

Here are a few tidbits that might help you figure out how my awful code works:

1. This game is written is JavaScript.
2. This game is built with the Meteor framework.
3. It runs on a Mongo database. You won't be able to see the database collections
   but knowing this might help you understand the code.
4. There's no single entry point for the app code - I use (and love) Meteor's
   autoloading of files - but you should check out this file to start:
   `/client/layouts/generic-layout.html`
